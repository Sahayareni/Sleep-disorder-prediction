# Sleep-disorder-prediction
This project builds an AI-based two-stage model to detect and classify sleep disorders like Sleep Apnea, Insomnia, Restless Leg Syndrome, Parasomnias, and Narcolepsy, using machine learning and deep learning for accurate prediction and better sleep health management.

Project Description:

Sleep plays a vital role in maintaining physical and mental health, yet modern lifestyles have made sleep disorders increasingly common across all age groups. This project focuses on developing an AI-driven two-stage predictive system that can accurately identify and classify sleep disorders using machine learning and deep learning methods. The primary goal is to help in early detection and improve sleep health awareness through data-driven insights.

In the first stage, the model determines whether an individual is likely to have a sleep disorder or not. In the second stage, it classifies the specific disorder type among Sleep Apnea, Insomnia, Restless Leg Syndrome, Parasomnias, and Narcolepsy. The dataset integrates multiple attributes such as lifestyle patterns, physiological data, and behavioral characteristics, enabling the model to capture complex relationships between daily habits and sleep health.

Several algorithms were implemented and compared to achieve optimal results. Traditional models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost provided interpretable and accurate predictions, with the Random Forest–XGBoost hybrid model achieving the highest accuracy of around 99%. In parallel, deep learning models like Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were used to learn non-linear patterns and enhance detection robustness.

The project also includes a user input interface, allowing individuals to enter personal and lifestyle data to receive real-time predictions and personalized recommendations for improving sleep quality. Insights from the analysis showed that 7,383 participants had no disorder, while 2,617 exhibited one or more types of sleep disorders, with Sleep Apnea being the most prevalent.

By combining machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid modeling, this project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to support digital healthcare, early diagnosis, and preventive wellness. It provides a scalable framework for integrating real-world data from wearable devices, ultimately contributing to smarter and healthier sleep management.
